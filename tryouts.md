The Gettysburg Youth Soccer Club (GYSC) is always looking for potential players. GYSC holds an open tryout in April or May for players to join teams the following Fall. In addition, players can also attend regular training sessions during the season and fill open roster spots.

For additional information about tryouts and other playing opportunities, please contact Mike Bishop at <a href="mailto:mbishop@gettysburg.edu">mbishop@gettysburg.edu</a>.
