Dear Friend of Gettysburg Youth Soccer Club:

We are excited to team up with Hoss's Steak and Sea House to raise money for a very worthy cause. Please consider visiting the Hoss's location(s) listed below on 11/13/2013 to aid us in raising money to benefit Gettysburg Youth Soccer Club.

Print this email and present it on 11/13/2013 at Hoss's in Gettysburg
Hoss's will then donate 20%* or 25%** of your total check paid to Gettysburg Youth Soccer Club

*To qualify for the 20% payout, our group must have a minimum of $300.00 in total pre-tax food and beverage sales.
**To qualify for the 25% payout, our group must have a minimum of $1,200.00 in total pre-tax food and beverage sales.
This applies to a one-day, single location, pre-scheduled event. The purchase of gift cards is not included as part of your organization’s community fundraising totals.

DISTRIBUTING INVITATIONS ON HOSS’S PROPERTY IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND WILL DISQUALIFY OUR ORGANIZATION! Thank you for your cooperation!
