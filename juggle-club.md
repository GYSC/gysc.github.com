The Gettysburg Youth Soccer Club (GYSC) Juggle Club is a great way for players to practice juggling and be recognized for their achievements. 

Juggling provides a solid foundation for creating a great touch on the ball. The more touches a player gets with the ball, the more comfortable and confident they will become. 

###Here's how the Juggle Club works

Players will juggle on their own and when they feel they can reach a benchmark, they will juggle in front of a GYSC coach or provide a video of them juggling to a GYSC coach. 

Players will receive a color-specific bracelet for each benchmark that they meet. In addition, the player on each team with the highest number of juggles at the end of the year will receive additional prizes.

The specific benchmarks are provided below. The first five benchmarks (5, 15, 25, 35, and 50 juggles) must include a majority of the juggles with your feet. All benchmarks greater than 50 must include all juggles with your feet.

###GYSC Juggle Club sponsor

We would like to thank the Blue & Gray Bar/Grill for their generous sponsorship of the Juggle Club.
