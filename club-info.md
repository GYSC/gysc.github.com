The Gettysburg Youth Soccer Club (GYSC) provides soccer training and playing opportunities for both boys and girls in the Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas of south central Pennsylvania. The GYSC coaching staff includes professional trainers as well as qualified non-professional coaches – all with the aim towards providing amazing opportunities for kids to enjoy the “beautiful game.”

Playing Opportunities: GYSC provides teams for both boys and girls from u9 through u15. Ages are determined by a school year calendar from August 1 – July 31. An age chart is available at the Eastern Pennsylvania Youth Soccer website.

In some situations, players may play up an age group, but players cannot play down an age group. The GYSC Board and the GYSC Technical Director will determine whether a player should play up an age group.

GYSC also provides playing opportunities for kids 5 – 8 through a partnership with the South Central Pennsylvania Soccer Academy (SCPASA) Junior Academy. The SCPASA Junior Academy provides an introduction to soccer in an environment that is great for learning and having fun. Additional information about the SCPASA Junior Academy is available on the SCPASA website.

Leagues: Most GYSC teams play in the Central Pennsylvania Youth Soccer League (CPYSL). Each season, half the games are played in Gettysburg and the other half are played around south central Pennsylvania – usually within 45 minutes of Gettysburg.

Tournaments: Each GYSC team participates in two tournaments in Gettysburg. One tournament is at the end of August and the other tournament is at the end of May. Additional tournaments may be played on a team-by-team basis.

Facilities: GYSC teams train mostly at James Gettys Elementary School, located in Gettysburg. Other locations around Gettysburg, PA are also used. In the Winter, GYSC uses indoor facilities in Gettysburg to train.

Home games for GYSC are also played at James Gettys Elementary School.

The address for James Gettys Elementary School is: 898 Biglerville Road, Gettysburg, PA 17325.
